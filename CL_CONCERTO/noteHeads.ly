% Offsets are entered as a series of numbers.
%   The value of 0 causes no offset-calculation to occur and places the note at the default side of the stem:
%     The left side for a stem pointing up and 
%     the right side for a stem pointing down.
%     (Per default, additional NoteHeads may have been placed on the opposite side of the stem to avoid collisions.)
%   Use 1 to shift a note head to the right.
%   Use -1 to shift a note head to the left.
%
% The amount of the offset is automatically determined based on 
%   the width of the notehead and the width of the stem.
%   (When there is a stem, a note head is offset by the width of the notehead 
%   minus half the width of the stem.  This will correctly align the note head 
%   with any others above or below it on the same side of the stem.)
%
% You can use larger or smaller values (like 1.1 or -0.9) 
%   to adjust the amount of the offset.
%
% In some cases offsetting a note head will cause the stem to no longer 
%   attach to it properly.  (The main (or only?) case where this is needed 
%   is when a note head that is at the end of a stem has been offset to the 
%   non-default side of the stem.)  To fix this, you can override the 'stem-attachment 
%   property.  The adjustStem function below makes this easier.  It takes a pair of 
%   numbers.  The first number adjusts the stem attachment on the X-axis (left or right) 
%   and the second number adjusts it on the Y-axis (up or down).  The first number 
%   indicates a multiple of the width of the stem that is added to the stem attachment 
%   position on the X-axis.  The second number is multiplied by the default position 
%   on the Y-axis to arrive at the new position on the Y-axis.  See examples below.  
%
% In a case where the parent note head of a Script is offset, the 
%   setOtherScriptParent function below can be used to select a different 
%   parent note head, in order to keep the Script in its original position.  See 
%   example below.
